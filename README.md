## glue.ai social robotics software - nextgen experiments

The glue.ai 1.x stack (mostly unchanged since 2017-Q2) is defined by a set of sub-projects described at:\
http://glue.ai

This glue-ai-ng repository on github contains preliminary experiments to be shaped into glue.ai 2.x features in 2018, 2019, ...

We expect Glue.ai 2.x to be based on semantic models, RDF, math, and our new companion project:\  
Axiomagic:  https://github.com/stub22/axiomagic

The concrete reference implementation will use Scala, Akka, and probably maven.
