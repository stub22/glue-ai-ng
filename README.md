# glue-ai-ng - social robotics software - nextgen experiments

## glue.ai 2.0 
This glue-ai-ng repository on github contains preliminary experiments to be shaped into glue.ai 2.x features in 2019.
### Information Architecture 
We expect Glue.ai 2.x to be based on semantic models, RDF, math, and our new companion project:   
	[Axiomagic](https://github.com/stub22/axiomagic)  
	
+ [Solid Binding](./survey/surv_linkd/SolidGlue.md)
+ Second thing  
 
### Reference Implementation
The concrete reference implementation will use Scala, Akka, and probably maven.

### Glue.ai 1.0 (no new development planned)
