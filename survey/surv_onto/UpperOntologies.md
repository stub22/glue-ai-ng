"KBpedia is a comprehensive knowledge structure for promoting data interoperability and knowledge-based artificial intelligence, or KBAI. The KBpedia knowledge structure combines six (6) public knowledge bases — Wikipedia, Wikidata, OpenCyc, GeoNames, DBpedia, and UMBEL — into an integrated whole. KBpedia's upper structure, or knowledge graph, is the KBpedia Knowledge Ontology. We base KKO on the universal categories and knowledge representation theories of the great 19th century American logician, polymath and scientist, Charles Sanders Peirce."
